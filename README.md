User spends a good amount of money on their ticket, their flights, their lodging, etc in hopes of having a memorable and safe experience at a festival with friends both old and unknown (as of yet)

@ User is at Artist and Artist is about to perform their set
Once Artist begins their set, the fun begins

> cut in throughout the video is a qr code that links to the video being recorded via an NFT. That NFT is immediately minted to the User upon uploading the video. QR code links to our site with a listing of metadata about that recording, including the transaction on Solscan, maybe the artist recorded, how long into their set it was, and generic position of the user in the crowd. This information will not be PII because due to the user recording the video and uploading it, they are already identifying the fact that they were there.
